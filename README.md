Challenge developed during Digital Innovation One's GFT Start #4 Java Bootcamp, which explores the pillars of object-oriented programming, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation to solve this challenge.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- instantiate the current account and savings account classes.
- use the methods: withdraw, deposit and transfer.

## My process

### Built with

- Java

### What I learned

This challenge clarified some doubts about the object-oriented programming paradigm, such as access modifiers and the super variable, in which you can access the methods of the parent class. Abstraction was not a very clear concept for me, but I realized that its concept was based on how to break the problem down, so that I can have a better understanding of it.
